Metro Redux contains polished versions of Metro 2033 and Metro Last Light in a single package at a decent price.

In this game the world has been turned to hell after a nuclear apocalypse around the time when LCD monitors were mainstream. Everyone in this world speaks english with an heavy russian accent shouting your name at every wim, cuz you are _Artyom and everyone fucking loves that name._

You run around underground metro stations and some short trips to the surface searching for ammo and air filters, cuz radiation, mutated animals, evil Russians and the fucking lack of ammo and air filters.

The story is really good, but sometimes you kinda feel like your just going to point B because you just have to. I would like more explanation on why I should go "there", I would not trust people that easily in a post-apocalyptic world.
