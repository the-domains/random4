Plex Server on my Ubuntu 14.04 went totally apeshit one day and would not load the web interface. Why?, I did not update the VM, it was silently just hammering along day by day.

Spooling up a new VM and installing Plex and mounting samba took 10 minutes, my copy pasta keyboard skills were so epic that a full size orchestra could not keep up. 

Phew, Plex does want to show me the web interface. **Brilliant**, now let's just log into my account..

And then it exploded, some strange update in Plex got the webinterface to hang when connecting the Plex server to a Plex user account. Fuck it I'll let it be in "non-botnet-mode" for a while, can still watch my stuffs anyways.
On a positive note the ffmpeg package in deb-multimedia is more stable than Ubuntu's.
